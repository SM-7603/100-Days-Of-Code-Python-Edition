# Conventional Commits Guide for Dummies

## Basic INFO

Since I'll be working on simple projects for "myself" I don't really need the full range of conventional commits.

> So, I'll focus on the ones that are most relevant to learning projects. 

## Types of commits

Here are the commit types I might find most useful:

    - feat: Used when adding a new feature or functionality to your program.
    - fix: Used when you fix a bug or correct an issue in your program.
    - docs: Useful for any documentation changes, comments, or explanations you add to your code.
    - chore: Can be used for various maintenance tasks, like setting up your project, organizing files, etc.
    - style: For changes related to code formatting, whitespace, or style improvements.
    - refactor: Use this type when you make changes to the code that aren't necessarily fixes or features, but involve restructuring or improving the code.
    - test: If you're adding or modifying tests for your program, use this type.

> Given that you're learning and working on simple projects, these types should cover most of your scenarios. Remember, the key is to maintain a clear and meaningful history of your code changes. You can adapt the types as needed based on your projects and their requirements.
